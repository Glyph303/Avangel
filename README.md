-Blockchain: Stacks blockchain (smart contracts with Clarity)

-Wallet: Leather Wallet (for authentication & transactions)

-Smart Contract Language: Clarity

📖 Rules of Blackjack (Simplified)

-Each player starts with two cards.

-The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

-Hit → Draw another card.

-Stand → End your turn.

-If you go over 21, you bust and lose.

-The player closest to 21 wins.

-On Stacks, the final result is committed to the blockchain for fairness and transparency.

🔗 Blockchain Integration

-The game logic runs in JavaScript (frontend) but critical state transitions (wins, busts, balances) are secured via a Clarity smart contract.

-Stacks blockchain ensures transparency and prevents cheating.

-Leather Wallet is used for:

-Player authentication

-Transaction signing


💡 Future Improvements

-Add card graphics instead of just numbers.

-Implement betting system with STX tokens.

-Add multiplayer over the network.

-Add animations for card dealing and blockchain confirmations.
